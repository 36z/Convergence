Convergence
--------------------

This is a fork of Moxie Marlinspike's Convergence tool: http://convergence.io/

Good high-level overview of the tool can be found in Moxie's "SSL And The Future
Of Authenticity" talk at BlackHat USA 2011: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA

See README in `server` section for details on running notary and `client` for
browser extension.


### This fork

Short-term goals of the fork is to integrate existing non-merged third-party
fixes/enhancements and extend client compatibility to newer firefox versions.

More long-term goal is to extend backends for integration with
[CrossBear](https://pki.net.in.tum.de/), OONI and related projects.
